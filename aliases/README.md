# aliases/

This directory contains aliases and short functions.

## Notes

* Some aliases use environment variables *(e.g. ${EDITOR})* which must be defined or replaced if possible.

* Aliases that work with files do not support file names with spaces.

* Some aliases require a common dependency (e.g. gcc).
