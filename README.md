# Contributing

If you would like to contribute, please ensure that your contribution adheres to the respective [guideline](https://github.com/computingfoundation/general-purpose-computing/wiki). Here is a list of [needed solutions](https://github.com/computingfoundation/general-purpose-computing/wiki/Needed-solutions); it can be used for ideas.

An alternative implementation to an already existing solution will be accepted only if it has substantial reason, such as using a different dependency or language.

Finally, credits will be placed in the wiki.

Please send an email to main@computingfoundation.org with any suggestions, comments or questions.
